Here’s the Demo-site with the changes I made to the original pre-workout generator, so you can test it beforehand:

I made these changes to enhance the website’s user experience, navigation, and responsiveness, while also improving text clarity and code readability.

# Summary of Changes:

## 🖌 UI/UX Improvements

1) Added Next and Back buttons for smoother navigation
    - Next button remains visible until step 2 (timeSection)
    - Back button allows users to check previous snack lists or modify steps without resetting
2) Updated Réinitialiser button to red to prevent accidental clicks
3) Refined CSS layout & button styles to match the original design of [bedietonic.com](https://www.bedietonic.com/par-ici/?fbclid=PAZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAabvE3tTKTMMMVFAyyKx1oG2GQKns7gXJJTAqFNwfsLafrz9Qyp0pNPUHXk_aem_J-F0Bs4nLcSM4HZoQX3u_Q)
   
## 📏 Text & Code Clarity

4) Added an ↑ arrow to “Le plus rapide” for better reference
5) Clarified text labels for better understanding:
    - "Le repas" → "Ce repas" : to clarify it’s about the pre-workout snack, not any meal
    - Renamed variable: buttomSection → bottomSection for better readability
  
## 🐛 Bug Fixes & Structure Adjustments

6) Added a main container for a better layout structure
7) Placed script.js at the end of <body> for better script execution


I hope these improvements are helpful! Let me know if you have any feedback or if anything needs adjusting.

Thanks, Raph, for this awesome tool~! 😊
